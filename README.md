Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
-- The driverPass project is a tool that help train students to pass thier tests. DriverPass wants to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests. The client is DriverPass and working with Liam the owner of DriverPass. The client wants us to design a website that will be able to handle all the classes, updated with DMV guidelines and be able to make appointments for a driving test.
What did you do particularly well?
-- What I feel I did well was creating the UML Diagrams to explain what the website will do with the client. I was able to complete how the project will be at the end.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
-- I would want to try to do more of the UML Activity. Explain every function of the DriverPass project.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
-- I would a brainstorm on what needs to be implemented in my design. I would put what I know and start adding the features that the clients wants. It is important to consider the user's needs because this is thier vision. We are there to make it look like how they want it.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
-- I always have to reasearch anything about what needs to be done. I need to be up to date with all the types of Operating Softwares, Browsers, and mobile devices. I would then show how I will start with thier design and change based on the user ideas and feedback.
